# Pack of 150 colorschemes for VIM

This is just a collection of all the vim colorschemes I've been collecting over time from the web. 
My favorite one is ir_black.

## How to get them all

If you are using Pathogen, 

  cd ~/.vim/bundle
  git clone https://github.com/luckydev/150colors.git 150colors

Or just do this:

  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/luckydev/150colors.git 
  cp ~/150colors/colors/* ~/.vim/colors/

Create the `colors/` directory inside ~/.vim/ if it doesn't exist.

Not sure what license I need to add in this project. So no LICENSE file.
